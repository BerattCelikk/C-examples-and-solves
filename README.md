**Mastering system-level efficiency through rigorous algorithmic implementation.**

</div>

## 📖 Project Overview

The **C-Core Laboratory** is a specialized repository hosting a diverse collection of C programming examples, algorithmic challenges, and system-level solutions. Developed as a foundational technical asset of the **Codiom** initiative, this project demonstrates a deep understanding of memory management and computational efficiency.

As a Software Engineering student at Istanbul Aydın University, I utilize this repository to explore the granular control provided by C—tackling complex data structures and optimization problems that form the backbone of modern software architecture.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧩 Algorithmic Mastery:** Implementations of classic and complex algorithms, focused on minimizing time and space complexity.
* **💾 Memory Management:** Rigorous use of pointers, dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`), and manual memory deallocation.
* **🛠️ Data Structure Lab:** Built-from-scratch implementations of Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Trees.
* **🔍 Bitwise Operations:** Advanced techniques for bit-level manipulation and performance optimization.
* **🛡️ Defensive Programming:** Strict adherence to input validation and boundary checks to prevent common C-related vulnerabilities.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Category | Technology | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Language**| **C (C11/C17)** | Core development and low-level logic implementation. |
| **Compiler** | **GCC / Clang** | Compiling and optimizing machine code for diverse architectures. |
| **Build Tools** | **Make / CMake** | Managing multi-file compilation and build pipelines. |
| **Debugging** | **GDB / Valgrind** | Memory leak detection and runtime debugging. |
| **Environment** | **Linux / Unix** | Primary development and testing environment. |

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The repository is architected to separate theoretical algorithmic solutions from practical system-level utility scripts.



### Complexity Analysis
Every solution is benchmarked against Big O notation to ensure industrial efficiency:

* **Time Complexity ($T(n)$):** Optimization of loops and recursive calls.
* **Space Complexity ($S(n)$):** Careful management of heap and stack memory usage.
